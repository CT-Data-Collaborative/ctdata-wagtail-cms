The flurry of data around migration patterns in Connecticut, the conflicting messages about whether the state is losing or gaining population is confusing \\u2013 and I\\u2019m someone who looks at data frequently! I thought about having a session at our next\\u00a0<a href=\\\"http://ctdata.org/conference/\\\">conference</a>\\u00a0(June 28th) on the different sources of migration data and what the data actually say but the agenda filled up with requests from our users and my riveting idea didn\\u2019t make it to the top.</p><p>However, when I saw this email and then the additional claim that $3.8 billion left with the 27,000 people I decided it was time to shed some light on this data. Although the infographic in the newsletter does not mention the data source, when I went to the report it was as I suspected \\u2013 the IRS Migration files.</p><p>I\\u2019ve looked at this data and I too was tempted to use it the way they aggregated and summarized the data. However, there are a few problems with the conclusions they drew from this particular dataset.</p><h3>About the data</h3><p>These data released by the IRS look at year-to-year address changes reported on individual income tax returns. These data track state and county level in and out flows of tax returns along with providing aggregate Adjusted Gross Income (AGI). A net-migration number for states and counties can be calculated looking at the difference between the inflows and outflows.</p><p>However the problem arises when the AGI is used to calculate income losses or gains. These back-of-the-envelope calculations can lead to inaccurate claims about what is happening and what these data actually tell us.</p><h2>3 Reasons you cannot assume Adjusted Gross Income (AGI) follows a person</h2><ol><li><p>Most people cannot take their income with them \\u2013\\u00a0when people move\\u00a0due to a change in employment,\\u00a0the job (and wages) remain in the stateand just the person moves. The job then gets filled by another person and the wages remain in the state \\u2013 therefore not necessarily a loss of overall AGI to the state.</p></li><li><p>Some income may transfer to other people in the state \\u2013 for example, if a small business owner leaves Connecticut, another small business owner in the state may gain customers \\u2013 increasing income within the state that won\\u2019t be captured in the IRS migration data.</p></li><li><p>Not all income is lost if a person moves \\u2013 some people move their physical location but some people leave a state but continue to work there. Yes it is true that some income does follow a person such as \\u2013Social Security, investment earnings, and pensions.</p></li></ol><p>The income that is \\u2018lost\\u2019 when people move typically goes to two groups</p><ul><li>People moving into the state replace the majority of the income of people moving out</li><li>People entering the state\\u2019s labor force receive most of the rest of the income previously earned by those who left - these people aren\\u2019t necessarily migrating</li></ul><p>Yes, Connecticut data from the IRS files, show an overall net out-migration of households</p><p>BUT</p><p>An analysis by the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities1\\u00a0that examined the national data from 1993-2011, show\\u00a0that for every state that experienced net out migration, those states also experienced\\u00a0an increase in the total number of people employed\\u00a0(measured by an increase in new non-farm jobs). For CT, although it lost 135,000 households, it also filled the jobs of those who left2\\u00a0and generated 94,000 new jobs.</p><h2>Another Problem: Cannot compare to previous years because the Data Changed</h2><p>When you go to the IRS website, it explicitly states that AGI data prior to 2011-2012 cannot be compared to earlier years. Beginning with data for 2011\\u20132012, the IRS introduced a number of enhancements to improve the data\\u2019s overall quality, as well as provide a new series of information, therefore\\u00a0these data are not comparable to prior years. Under the new methodology, full-year data are now available. Previously only individual tax returns filed before the end of September were included.</p><p>As a result of the changes that were made in their methodology, it now includes late filers. And as it turns out, late filers generally have higher incomes thus it is not surprising that the overall reported AGI increased.</p><h2>Other Limitations of the IRS Migration Data</h2><p>Assuming all income is \\u2018lost\\u2019 when people move also exaggerates the actual amount</p><ul><li>Counting all the income of people who are retiring as \\u2018lost income\\u2019 is inaccurate because their wages would be \\u2018lost\\u2019 even if they didn\\u2019t move</li><li>When people leave a state after being laid off, the state economy does not \\u2018lose income\\u2019 because they migrated; they migrated because they and the state lost income.</li><li>There is no requirement that the address on a federal tax return be that of the taxpayer\\u2019s legal sate of residence under state law. However, this dataset counts a change of address as a move.</li></ul><h2>Census Data does not support the claim of \\u2018lost\\u2019 income</h2><p>What\\u2019s also interesting \\u2013 when I looked at the distribution of household income as reported by the Census, I actually found that the percent of households in the highest income bracket increased as a percentage of all households in Connecticut \\u2013 challenging the idea that the wealthy are leaving.</p>\"}, {\"type\": \"pym_iframe\", \"value\": {\"title\": \"Statewide Income Distribution, 2000 to 2014\", \"bucket_name\": \"income-distribution-irs-income-flows\", \"notes\": \"\", \"source\": \"\"}}, {\"type\": \"paragraph\", \"value\": \"Out migration is a concern.

However, in Connecticut, it is important to note that many of the grants are not provided as a measure to equalize fiscal disparities. These grants are aimed at providing towns with lost revenue \\u2014 in the case of lost property taxes \\u2014 or for specific projects.</p><p>For example, there are a number of different non-school grants made by the state, with the largest type of grant being payments-in-lieu-of-taxes (PILOT) for state-owned and private colleges and hospital property. In addition, there are Mashantucket Pequot-Mohegan grants, the Town Aid Road program, Local Capital Improvement Program (LoCIP), elderly tax relief, property tax relief for veterans and the disabled, and Department of Housing (DoH) tax abatement program (formerly of the Department of Economic and Community Development). However, statewide these grants account for a small percentage of local non-school spending \\u2014 only 8% in FY 2011.</p><p>The NEPPC examined the distribution of non-school grants compared to towns municipal gap (capacity to raise revenue minus costs) to determine how well, or not, they were working as a mechanism for equalizing the disparities. A positive municipal gap means the town has revenue capacity greater than its costs, while a negative fiscal gap means the town does not have enough revenue capcity to cover its costs.</p><p>The scatterplot below shows the relationship between a town\\u2019s municipal gap and the amount of non-school grants received from the state. The x-axis (horizontal) displays the municipal gap, and the y-axis (vertical) is the value of the non-school grants.</p><p>Although the scatterplot shows in general a positive trend (in a perfect relationship between the gap and grants, the dots would display as a diagonal line), there are many communities with the same municipal gap that receive different amounts in state grants.

In addition to making the data public through exploratory, web-based visualization tools, CTData presents a few of the interesting trends in the story below. As we build out the portal, we will continue to examine the trends in the data and share the stories.</p><h2>What Businesses file with the Secretary of the State?</h2><p>As required by law, certain business entities must register with the Secretary of the State\\u2019s (SOTS) office. The types of businesses that must register include: Business Corporations, Nonstock Corporations, Benefit Corporations, Limited Liability Companies, Limited Liability Partnerships, Limited Partnerships and Statutory Trusts.

In general, both formations and dissolutions have been on an upward trend. As shown in the chart, the number of business establishments tends to rise and fall with the business cycles of the overall economy.</p><p>In each of the recessions, business formations started declining leading up to each of the recessions.

The BET was enacted in 2002 and became effective in 2003. Principals of defunct entities were held personally liable for the back-owed BET liability of their defunct entities. After getting hit with a penalty-and-interest-laden tax bill, many of these entities filed their dissolutions rapidly, to avoid additional exposure for future tax years.

One such effort included a postcard campaign to entities with out-of-date Annual Reports, requesting them to either file a dissolution or else file back-owed Annual Reports to catch up. Businesses that were no longer active would have filed dissolutions to avoid the fees associated with filing Annual Reports.</p><h2>Establishment Survival</h2><p>We also examined the lifespan of businesses as a factor of the year in which they formed. To do this, we examined the number of entities that filed formation paperwork in any given year and calculated the number of years in existence until a dissolution filing.</p><h4>After 10-15 years in business, 60-70 percent are still in existence</h4><p>This line chart shows how many survive from year to year.

Attendees engaged with state agency leaders and scholars around new data initiatives and projects, including the State Department of Education\\u2019s EdSight platform, the Office of Early Childhood\\u2019s Integrated Data System and migration research in progress.</p><p>Back by popular demand, we held Ignite presentations, showcasing research across the state focused on \\u201cCounting What Matters\\u201d from the Department of Labor, the State\\u2019s Population Center, the Department of Children and Families, the Racial Profiling Prohibition Project and the Open Communities Alliance. The presentations covered a range of topics from employment metrics to housing data, survey data to administrative data, data challenges and successes. This engaging style has proved popular with conference-goers who enjoy hearing \\u201csound bytes\\u201d of research in progress.</p><p>Before we broke for lunch, we convened a panel discussing regionalism and existing opportunities and challenges when constructing regional services and relationships.</p><p>The slate of afternoon offerings was just as exciting as the morning. After a delicious lunch (with thanks to the amazing folks at the Kitchen at Billings Forge), attendees chose from sessions about data-driven advocacy for racial justice, homelessness and our pilot of CTData Academy\\u2019s Data 101 session.</p><p>The day ended with a keynote address from Dr. Jacob Hacker, Stanley Resor Professor of Political Science and Director of the <a href=\\\"http://isps.yale.edu/\\\">Institution for Social and Policy Studies</a> at Yale University. A regular media commentator and policy adviser, he is the author or co-author of five books, numerous journal articles, and a wide range of popular writings on American politics and public policy. His most recent book, written with Paul Pierson, is American Amnesia: How the War on Government Led Us to Forget What Made America Prosper\\u2014a New York Times Book Review Editor\\u2019s Choice just named a best business book of 2016 by the management magazine Strategy+Business.</p><p>Dr. Hacker offered his thoughts on data and research in his talk entitled, \\u201cHow to Measure and Improve Well-Being - And Why That\\u2019s More Essential than Ever.\\u201d He emphasized that, \\u201cmeasures matter, what we measure matters, and we need to move beyond the aggregate.\\u201d He encouraged all of us to continue doing our work, it\\u2019s more essential than ever, and we must speak loudly about the importance of data. We are emboldened by his charge that data matters.</p><p>We have posted the slides and presentations to the <a href=\\\"http://ctdata.org/events/counting-what-matters-better-data-better-policy-ct/\\\">conference page </a>on our website, <a href=\\\"http://www.ctdata.org\\\">www.ctdata.org</a>, and have links to the CTData Academy offerings.

      "body": "[{\"type\": \"paragraph\", \"value\": \"<p>This is a summary of data presented by Thomas Cooke, Professor of Geography at the University of Connecticut and also a subsequent paper published by Manisha Srivastava in the <a href=\\\"http://www1.ctdol.state.ct.us/lmi/digest/pdfs/ceddec16.pdf\\\">December 2016 issue of the CT Economic Digest</a></p><p>We had our second forum in November -- with over 20 people present from all sectors, and unfortunately with our big conference in December and the holidays, I\\u2019m just writing the summary now! However, it\\u2019s timely as we start a new legislative session and decisions and anecdotes start to travel and whip through the halls of the Capitol and make their way to our news outlets.</p><p><br/>First, it\\u2019s important to put the migration of residents into and out of Connecticut in the context of what is happening at the national level. As depicted in the graphic below, nationally the rate for both types of migration (between states and within states) has been on the decline. In fact, most recently the rate of migration has been at it\\u2019s lowest level and only a small percentage of people move. The bottom line is that people are moving less.<br/></p><p><img height=\\\"388\\\" src=\\\"https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/Sl09lI4k4jY6fu3uHkN15GYJ4jkDN2O1EdhmAFgXrRZvQDOWgGigUqyOynpNt3ZRmFp7DTGfb3qCetA92YuRpOaHq6AErTMmBVfW_9-1O76d4T6X39BtZ6uZnKxUMtr6hbnDxE7K\\\" width=\\\"534\\\"/><br/></p><p>Let\\u2019s look closer at what is happening in Connecticut. In the media, the steady drumbeat that gets promulgated is that Connecticut is losing population. However, that is not entirely what is happening when you look at the data. If one only looks at DOMESTIC migration patterns, then one can say there is a net out-migration of people. </p><p><br/>The chart below illustrates average net Domestic migration from 2001 to 2014 for regions in the United States. The black squares represent the average of net migration from 2001 to 2014 and the bars represent the maximum and minimum that occurred in any one year during the time period covered. Connecticut\\u2019s migration is not dissimilar to that experienced by other New England states. However, the variance is bigger in terms of the highs and lows within each year (see graph below. Source:\\u00a0IHS, Census Population Estimates; as printed in CT Economic Digest, December 2016).</p><p><img height=\\\"193\\\" src=\\\"https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/KFstckJJwGK8XStSZ-MokAyxkLW9bW5_7klscNgO-azT7bMBllWKatvMi9blAYyhB8Cy1n3UQXyh1rtu4NqH0eo5LTh5HMpOm2bdll4VK1UjcYsLP9UkQfuOpQPB7rQcQxJa8Y2g\\\" width=\\\"463\\\"/><br/></p><p>But it doesn\\u2019t make sense when trying to understand inflows and outflows of people to disaggregate the data by domestic and international. When international migration is factored in, Connecticut\\u2019s net migration is positive. And although this was presented at the first forum, Professor Cooke looked at the migration patterns of working age adults with a college degree. This was to dispel the stereotype of what constitutes international migration. <br/></p><p><img height=\\\"352\\\" src=\\\"https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/L3EmCez6krBUZ2KrAfjydKuLdwuIFhQzraWuWXAuQoNqP9a69HS9IIdHCpikzCuV2OMKWAbaUwVq-vAzGL6qdovTxYhvlqXxsmHLWIJcwD5sVAFWvaLm784R9H5JLudrG6iv-6Mk\\\" width=\\\"624\\\"/><br/></p><p>With the context of general migration rates (lowest levels in more recent years) and net in-migration for Connecticut (with international migration playing an important role in Connecticut), for our second forum, we decided to take a deeper dive into the data - looking at Millenial migration and migration of the wealthy.</p><p><b><br/></b></p><p><i>Millenial Migration</i></p><p>Manisha Srivastava from CT Office of Policy and Management explored millenial migration in her analysis and the findings below represent a summary of her work.</p><p><b><br/></b></p><p>One might wonder, why so much attention is placed on millenials. The reason is that millenials make up the largest living generation (children of the boomers born between 1981 and 1997) and therefore have a large impact on the economy. </p><p><b><br/></b></p><p>The outstanding question is whether millenials\\u2019 preferences for urban living is a result of their age and therefore will change once they marry and have children and opt for suburban living, as previous generations have in the past, or if the preference for urban living remains. If they opt for the preferences of previous generations, it could be a boon for Connecticut where we have an abundant availability of suburban living, particularly when you look at the historical migration patterns for Connecticut by age cohort.</p><p><br/>In 2015, millennials were between the ages of 18 to 34. The peak year of births for the millennial cohort was 1990 when 4.2 million were born; in 2015 this cohort of millennials born in 1990 turned 25. Now that the peak number of millennials reached the age of 25, and at a point when they might be considering settling down, moving out of parent\\u2019s abode, and thinking about marriage and kids - Connecticut could benefit from a large shift in their preferences.<br/></p><p><a href=\\\"https://fivethirtyeight.com/datalab/think-millennials-prefer-the-city-think-again/\\\">Recent research</a> does suggest that millenials preferences are similar to generations before them.\\u00a0According to an analysis using 2014 Census data, more people age 25 to 29 moved out of cities into suburbs as opposed to the numbers moving into cities, this was also true for those in their early 20s. \\u00a0Across all ages, incomes, races, and education groups more Americans are still moving out of cities than in (urban populations are growing due to births and migration, not internal migration).<br/></p><br/>It is true that millenials are moving to the suburbs at a lower rate than previous generations did at the same age but that could also be due to delaying marriage and childbirth as opposed to forgoing it entirely\\u00a0(see graphs below. Source:\\u00a0IHS, Census Population Estimates; as printed in CT Economic Digest, December 2016).<p><img height=\\\"566\\\" src=\\\"https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/mZk81gWk-suYllQyP49IYktN0UKFOtBtopKjWOKkhI5Oo-rXRO4fYT46TZ4Y3JsuNJzeXbkAvYuW867KJyH5hD50zH0-mFQdgzRNgra7hDONJhvT3LINBt_fCEwKB8wDXkWJ-F1u\\\" width=\\\"461\\\"/><br/></p><p><br/></p><p></p><p><i><b>Migration of the wealthy</b></i></p><br/>The first the challenge is to define what is meant by \\u2018wealthy.\\u2019 For the purposes of this analysis, it is defined as those having investment income in the 99.5th percentile nationally. The investment income data are derived from the American Community Survey. \\u00a0In 2005, that was approximately $115,000 and in 2015 it was about $145,000. Since 2005, the number of Connecticut residents who are in the top 99.5th percentile has steadily increased as shown in the chart below.<br/><p></p><p><img height=\\\"421\\\" src=\\\"https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/5bEkyx3ojBsAJlsKmM3gpVW6Ha4r8epWEt563n24VCcZ48F5aPabUDhtFAr8-ML6aN9nxZddR7paUqCECe2OVc325RMhcY-_qcwyA-kkIDOpp9L17ozBw3l_ijoE1y0_Cm-aNhZp\\\" width=\\\"580\\\"/><br/></p><p>However, the net out migration of the wealthy is real. Although the actual number of people are small (averaging in the 300s in the past five years), and not large enough to counter the increase in wealthy residents, it still does have a revenue impact to the state.<br/></p><p><img height=\\\"340\\\" src=\\\"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/xR1oI6M6RbQBhNVjUITQIyJZI05dAim3mhzmZ1XKzNvyQUvrnaPBiX4DfioN_HLyO8bxGav1vLHzc7E6LRrA15gPtLTJ_W9DQszGdADW6Yd_REFdgqnlQa2y7A3QnFaADWVsOA3V\\\" width=\\\"580\\\"/><br/></p><p></p><p><br/></p><p><br/></p>We are very excited with the success of our first migration series. The goal was to convene interested parties across sectors and spawn new connections, research, and initiatives. Two groups formed from our initial meetings; one of which will put together a more in-depth analysis of migration and we look forward to presenting those results in the near future.\\u00a0<p></p><p><br/></p><p>If you have a topic that you'd like us to explore at a future forum, please reach out with your idea info@ctdata.org.</p>\"}]",

The current presidential administration and members of Congress have taken some concerning steps that may set back progress in data collection and open data access for advocates at the state and federal level.\\u00a0</p><p>First, we would like inform you of two companion bills, one is the <a href=\\\"https://www.congress.gov/bill/115th-congress/house-bill/482/text\\\">House</a>\\u00a0and one in the <a href=\\\"https://www.congress.gov/bill/115th-congress/senate-bill/103/text\\\">Senate</a>,\\u00a0with titles that refer to local zoning protections. However, both bills contain language that explicitly prohibits data collection that would allow us to disaggregate the data by race or ethnicity. Specifically Section 3 of both bills reads:\\u00a0</p><p>\\\"<i>Notwithstanding any other provision of law, no Federal funds may be used to design, build, maintain, utilize, or provide access to a Federal database of geospatial information on community racial disparities or disparities in access to affordable housing</i>.\\\"<br/></p><p>Researchers and advocates have long used information about race and ethnicity to understand the \\u201csocial determinants of health,\\u201d that is, the relationship between your community, your family and your health and long term outcomes. This research and understanding is only made possible through the availability of data that includes the race and ethnicity of people and are released for the public.<br/></p><p>Second, we see that dozens of datasets disappeared from open.whitehouse.gov last week, a website that Obama created to promote government transparency. The Obama White House began this effort in 2009 with the belief that the government\\u2019s data belongs to its citizens. In 2009, Obama signed the <a href=\\\"http://www.whitehouse.gov/the-press-office/transparency-and-open-government\\\">Memorandum on Transparency and Open Government</a>, stating, \\u201c<i>Information maintained by the Federal Government is a national asset.

The current presidential administration has not announced whether they will continue to collect and share the same kind of data available under the Obama administration. These data--like the White house visitor logs climate change data, or federal budget information--remain crucially important to understanding every facet of social life from the effects and influence of lobbying in Washington to how our tax dollars are spent.<br/></p>These are just two examples of changes taking place at the federal level that impact current data available and also attempts to hinder future data availability.

Unfortunately, more data will be suppressed because aggregations\\nby grade, for example, are not available on EdSight, and the education data we\\nused to report, while still accessible, will not be comparable to the new data.\\nThe good news is that we will be able to provide more education datasets than\\nwe did before.</p><p>\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n</p><p>We\\nwill now list each individual disaggregation that is available as a separate\\ndataset. For example, Chronic Absenteeism by English Language Learners, will be\\nits own dataset. Our pre-EdSight SDE datasets will be listed under the Education -&gt; Archived subtopic and will still be viewable through our visualization tools so that people can look at past trend\\ndata.</p><p><br/></p><h3>Challenges we face....</h3><p>One\\nof the things that we appreciate the most about EdSight is the way that data\\nare structured. With a few exceptions, the data are relatively <a href=\\\"http://vita.had.co.nz/papers/tidy-data.pdf\\\">tidy</a>, \\u00a0and this is a big step forward for working\\nwith data within scripting and programming environments. That said, EdSight's\\nuser interface presented a number of challenges for us.</p><p>1.\\nNo bulk download</p><p>While\\nwe ultimately publish data in smaller, topical datasets, we prefer to work with\\nbulk data whenever possible. EdSight lacks a mechanism to download\\n\\\"all\\\" of the data, either across the portal or within a topic\\ncategory. Within some datasets, some combinations of selections can produce a\\ncomprehensive version of the dataset, but this is not consistent.</p><p>2.\\nInconsistent interface</p><p>Some\\ndatasets are available directly from the main menu drop-downs. Others can only\\nbe reached by navigating within top-level categories (e.g. Discipline -&gt;\\nBullying). The site lacks a central list of the datasets and reports being\\ncurrently published. This makes it a challenge to keep track of what is\\navailable or to see the full list of available datasets in one view.</p><p>3.\\nSuboptimal downloaded file structure</p><p>\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nIf you've ever downloaded a few files from a\\ngiven dataset, you've probably noticed that they all receive the same name.\\nThis may be fine for 1 or 2 downloads, but this presents challenges for us as\\nwe try to process datasets that require us to combine multiple files.\\nFurthermore, the downloaded CSVs are not immediately machine readable by our\\nscripts. The first few rows of data contains a mix of descriptive data and data\\nnecessary to interpret the remaining rows. Specifically, year is only reported\\nin this descriptive section and is not included as a column variable. This\\nsaves a few bytes in terms of file size but makes it a challenge to join\\nmultiple files.<br/></p><h3><br/></h3><h3>Our solution</h3><p>To solve these issues\\nfor ourselves (and, we hope, for others), we've developed a command line tool\\nthat allows for semi-bulk downloading and exploration of EdSight datasets.<br/></p><h3><br/></h3><h3>How it works</h3><p>The\\ntool is fairly simple. It offers a way to list datasets and to display the\\nvariables available within a dataset.</p><p>Pass\\nin the name of a dataset and the geography you want to retrieve (district or school). The tool will initiate a process of downloading the individual csv files, naming them in a more\\ndescriptive manner, and storing them where you tell it. We also offer an option to download the entire EdSight catalog in one command. However, because this process takes a fairly long time and because it generates a fair amount of web traffic, we don't recommend using this option. Instead, you can grab the full catalog from our Github <a href=\\\"https://github.com/CT-Data-Collaborative/edsight-data\\\">repository</a> or download it <a href=\\\"https://github.com/CT-Data-Collaborative/edsight-data/archive/master.zip\\\">directly</a>.</p><h3><br/></h3><h3>What are we doing with this tool<br/></h3><p></p><p>First,\\nwe are updating and expanding our own <a href=\\\"http://data.ctdata.org/data_by_topic\\\">data catalog</a> to include the full range of\\ndata published on EdSight. This means our users will soon be able to browse and\\nvisualize EdSight data on ctdata.org using our interface and visualization\\ntools. For example, you will be able to compare multiple districts within a\\nparticular dataset over time.</p><p>Second,\\nwhile our datasets will be extracts of the data available on EdSight, we will\\nbe making bulk files available for <a href=\\\"https://github.com/CT-Data-Collaborative/edsight-data/archive/master.zip\\\">download</a>. We think of our tools as the\\nstarting point for analysis and exploration, and we want our users to be able\\nto take the data into whatever environment they are most comfortable with.</p><p>\\n\\n\\n\\n</p><p>Third,\\nwe are <a href=\\\"https://github.com/CT-Data-Collaborative/ctdata-edsight-cli\\\">releasing our tool</a> as an open source resource and we welcome feedback,\\nfeature requests, and collaboration. We anticipate making a number of\\nimprovements to the tool, but we suspect that our users will find things to\\naddress that we have yet to consider.</p><p><br/></p><p></p><h3>What else we want to do with this<br/></h3><p></p><p>Right now this tool has focused on solving a specific problem that we faced in processing this data. However, we want to make this broadly useful if possible.\\u00a0</p><p>We have a few ideas such as downloading all datasets but filtered by a set of districts/schools and having the option of preprocessing some of the datasets. However,\\u00a0we would welcome suggestions and requests from you. Please let us know if you have any ideas or feedback.</p><p></p>\"}]",

After 1960, people could select their own race and it was not until 2000 that Americans could choose more than one race to describe themselves, allowing for an estimate of the nation\\u2019s multiracial population. </p><p>As we approach the 2020 Census, major revisions to the race question are being considered.<br/></p><p>When both race and ethnicity questions are asked there is a high non-response rate and either race or ethnicity or both fields are left blank. This is a known problem for the census and in our work at the CT Data Collaborative, we\\u2019ve heard it from nonprofit providers throughout the state. \\u00a0<br/></p><p>During the 2010 Census, the largest quantitative effort ever on how people identify their race and ethnicity was conducted. The study mailed experimental questionnaires to a sample of 488,604 households, re-interviewed respondents and conducted 67 focus groups across the United States and in Puerto Rico with nearly 800 people.</p><p>The study tested several versions of an experimental combined question on race and Hispanic origin. The current OMB classification treats race and Hispanic origin as two separate and distinct concepts. During the 2010 Census, most households received a census form with separate questions for Hispanic origin and race in accordance with these guidelines but a \\u00a0sample of households received questionnaires with an experimental, combined question.</p><p>The results showed that a higher number of individuals were <i>more likely to respond</i> <i>to a combined race and Hispanic origin question</i> than to separate questions. The experimental combined questions had a non-response rate, meaning the percentage of respondents leaving that question blank, of roughly 1 percent, compared to 3.5 percent to 5.7 percent for the race question and 4.1 percent to 5.4 percent for the Hispanic origin question. </p><p>The population reporting Some Other Race alone was as high as 7.1 percent on the separate race question and roughly 0.2 percent on the combined questions. However, the percent of the population who identified as Hispanic was not significantly different across questionnaires, indicating that the total proportion of Hispanics was not reduced in a combined question approach.</p>For an interesting\\u00a0historical perspective on how race has been measured since 1790 check out this <a href=\\\"http://www.census.gov/population/race/data/MREAD_1790_2010.html\\\">graphic</a>.<br/><p></p><p><br/></p><p></p><p>Given the results of the tested combined question conducted during the 2010 Census, it's worth a consideration for nonprofits and social service providers to consider asking a combined race and ethnicity question to see if non-response rates decrease.

Following up on the success of \\\"Equip\\\" back in March, this time, we organized a conference around the theme, \\\"Synthesize.\\\" Issues related to data collection and analysis are perrenial challenges for many of our users. To respond to this need, we organized several panels focused on using data to tell stories and strategizing around how to collect new data for use in their work.\\u00a0</p><p>Over 100 people gathered at the Omni Hotel in New Haven for a morning of learning and networking. Attendees chose between two sets of breakout sessions. In the first series of breakout sessions, attendees split up to hear from a panel of local journalists about data storytelling and from a panel of researchers about the state of the state budget. We heard some important takeaways from the journalists about the importance of filtering a clear and simple story for your readers. As Stephen Busemeyer of the Hartford Courant put it, \\\"Avoid kitchen sink syndrome.\\\" Jake Kara and Jacqueline Rabe Thomas from the CT Mirror offered advice about using data to check assumptions and about being truthful in your analysis. Moderator, Mark Oppenheimer, advised participants to engage with the media when they don't have a story to share to start forging relationships and sharing their data.</p><p>Next door, Robert Santy of InformCT moderated the \\\"Re-Imagining the State Budget\\\" panel. First, Derek Thomas of Connecticut Voices for Children provided an overview of the state budget and the budget proposals currently in circulation at the capitol. Then Sarah Ficenec of\\u00a0the Connecticut Economic Resource Center\\u00a0presented a possible new direction for the state: outcome-based budgeting. Santy closed the panel with an impassioned plea to attendees to urge their legislators to adopt a new vision for the future of the state.</p><p>In the second series of breakout sessions, attendees chose between two panels, \\\"Data-Driven Decision Making\\\" and \\\"Where Do Data Come From?\\\" The \\\"Data-Driven\\\" panel featured three speakers explaining the way that they do \\\"data-driven\\\" in their work. Kathryn Gonnerman of the Jewish Community Foundation described their inaugural study of the Jewish population in Greater Hartford. Spencer Hill of the Commission on Human Rights and Opportunities explained the benefit of data-driven decision making in serving citizens bringing complaints to their office. And Jeana Bracey of the Child Health and Development Institute described the impact of the long-term, School Based Diversion Initiative. Each panelist brought a new perspective to identifying specific priorities and using information to drive decisions about those priorities.\\u00a0</p><p>In \\\"Where Do Data Come From,\\\" panelists, Emmanuel Adero from Connecticut Association of Human Services, Karyn Backus of CT Department of Public Health and Michael Polzella of the CT Department of Labor each explained some of the unique challenges with data collection and modifying your analytical plans when data simply do not exist. Data Collaborative Executive Director, Michelle Riordan-Nold, moderated the panel and provided context regarding the next Census collection in 2020.</p><p>After an engaging morning of learning, we heard from our keynote speaker, Alvin Chang. Chang is not a stranger to Connecticut as he was part of the team that started TrendCT at the CT Mirror. He is currently a Senior Graphics Reporter for Vox.com and he has adopted a creative way of communicating data: cartoons. So in his talk, \\\"Why I Use Cartoons To Tell Stories,\\\" he challenged the audience to consider the way readers learn new information and how to creatively synthesize information to reach them. He captured an important sentiment that many attendees have been feeling: data-driven decision making has come under attack and we are in an era when good rhetoric seems to be an acceptable substitution for data and evidence. Because data describes invisible things and because visualization of data has become popular and expected, we have to synthesize information to push readers to ask questions and be curious. Chang provided some entertaining examples of his own design choices and helped the audience understand how they can use basic tools to achieve simple and meaningful results in their data synthesis.\\u00a0</p><p>We look forward to closing out this series with our final installment, Mobilize with Data, on Tuesday, November 7th at the Hartford Public Library.

Advocates attempting to demonstrate these inequities are often hamstrung by insufficient or unavailable data to explain the issues at hand. In the last two years, our State Department of Education has developed a new system for measuring school accountability and incorporated a revised curriculum and standardized testing system, all while working with a broken system of school finance. In addition, the state's Office of Early Childhood has developed and rolled out a new Early Childhood Information System. New innovations offer an opportunity for advocates to demonstrate the case for inequity with rich and compelling data. In this panel, we explore existing work around equity in education, focusing on the new ways to measure and account for disadvantages and the challenges advocates moving forward.</p>"

The existing research in these areas shows that citizens of color in Connecticut are disproportionally impacted by the criminal justice, health care, and child welfare systems.
